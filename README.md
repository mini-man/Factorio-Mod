# Factorio-Mod
My Factorio Mod that I am going to try to make in my spare time 
This mod will hopefully make Factorio metal processing more lifelike
I will not beable to make this mod very fast for several reasons:
1. I am in my last 2 years of school and starting my HSC - final exams for those not in AUS
2. I'm basically going to make this in my free time which is pretty limited maybe an hour a week, I hope
3. I'm haven't made a single mod for any game but I do have a pretty good understanding of modding and coding
4. I haven't made anything on GitHub and am still new to the whole deal
Please help out if you want, I'm still in the mind map stages but help would be appreciated
